                <p>Some patients may continue with stable kidney function for years without requiring dialysis. Others
                    may show relentless worsening and reach a stage necessitating dialysis.</p>
                <p>There are two types of dialysis: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Hemodialysis that uses a machine to purify the blood directly after circulating through an
                        artificial
                        kidney or filter.</li>
                    <li>Peritoneal Dialysis â€“ this is done through the abdomen where the peritoneal membrane filters
                        the
                        wastes and excess water from the body. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sanjeevani's Dialysis unit has 3 dedicated beds. </p>
                <p>It has a Gamro Machine with Centralized O2 / Suction and Air Compressor. </p>
                <p>It is under constant supervision by well trained Dialysis technicians & Doctors.</p>
