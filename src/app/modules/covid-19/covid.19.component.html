                            <p>COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. It's caused by a virus
                                called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
                                Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of
                                breath
                                and breathing difficulties.</p>
                            <p>In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome,
                                kidney failure and even death.
                                Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing,
                                covering
                                mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and thoroughly cooking food. Avoid close
                                contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and
                                sneezing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to a study published by WHO, the virus cannot sustain at higher temperatures.
                                Hence, prevent eating raw and outside food, and ensure that food is heated properly
                                before consumption.

                                <p>Although there are vaccines available for prevention of Covid-19, we should continue
                                    to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. People with serious
                                    illness should be hospitalized. Sanjeevani Hospital provides excellent care for
                                    Covid-19 patients.
                                    Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.</p>
                                <p>Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses.
                                    But ensure that you increase your immunity by eating and drinking healthy.
                                    Once infected, the treatment aims to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the
                                    illness.
                                    You'll need to stay in isolation,
                                    away from other people, until you have recovered.</p>

                                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
                                    respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of
                                    COVID-19
                                    associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash
                                    your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout
                                    the
                                    day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the
                                    bathroom.
                                    It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                                    that
                                    has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                                    but
                                    this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
                                    In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there
                                    is
                                    likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over

                                    period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                    Close contacts should also follow these recommendations:
                                    Make sure that you understand and can help the patient follow their healthcare
                                    provider’s instructions for medication(s) and care. You should help the patient with
                                    basic needs in the home and provide support for getting groceries, prescriptions,
                                    and
                                    other personal needs.
                                    Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his or her
                                    healthcare provider and tell them that the patient has laboratory-confirmed
                                    COVID-19.
                                    This will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people in
                                    the
                                    office or waiting room from getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call

                                    local or state health department for additional guidance. If the patient has a
                                    medical
                                    emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that the patient
                                    has,
                                    or is being evaluated for COVID-19.
                                    Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the patient as
                                    much
                                    as possible. Household members should use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if
                                    available.
                                    Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home.
                                    Household members should care for any pets in the home. Do not handle pets or other
                                    animals while sick. For more information, see COVID-19 and Animals.
                                    Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an air
                                    conditioner or an opened window, weather permitting.
                                    Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at
                                    least
                                    20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol,
                                    covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.
                                    Soap
                                    and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.
                                    Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
                                    The patient should wear a facemask when you are around other people. If the patient
                                    is
                                    not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), you,
                                    as
                                    the caregiver, should wear a mask when you are in the same room as the patient.
                                    Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the
                                    patient’s
                                    blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.
                                    Throw out disposable facemasks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.
                                    When removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of gloves.
                                    Then,
                                    immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
                                    Next,
                                    remove and dispose of facemask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and
                                    water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
                                    Avoid sharing household items with the patient. You should not share dishes,
                                    drinking
                                    glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items. After the patient
                                    uses
                                    these items, you should wash them thoroughly (see below “Wash laundry thoroughly”).
                                    Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom
                                    fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also,
                                    clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
                                    Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions. Labels
                                    contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including
                                    precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and
                                    making
                                    sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.
                                    Wash laundry thoroughly.
                                    Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body
                                    fluids on
                                    them.
                                    Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from
                                    your
                                    body. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer)
                                    immediately after removing your gloves.
                                    Read and follow directions on labels of laundry or clothing items and detergent. In
                                    general, using a normal laundry detergent according to washing machine instructions
                                    and
                                    dry thoroughly using the warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label.
                                    Place all used disposable gloves, facemasks, and other contaminated items in a lined
                                    container before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands
                                    (with
                                    soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these
                                    items. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.
                                    Discuss any additional questions with your state or local health department or
                                    healthcare provider. Check available hours when contacting your local health
                                    department.
