                <div class="p-header">What is Cardiology?</div>
                <p>Cardiology is the discipline that researches, diagnoses and treats heart injuries and diseases as
                    well as their causes. A cardiologist will treat your heart problem while staying aware of other
                    conditions, including high blood pressure, high Cholesterol, diabetes and other factors that risk
                    damaging the heart. Some of these risk factors include a family history of heart disease, obesity,
                    cigarette smoking, poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
                <div class="p-header">Who is at Risk?</div>
                <p>Many people think that heart attacks are a “man’s problem,” yet heart disease is actually the number
                    one killer of both men and women in the United States. In men, the risk for heart attack increases
                    signiﬁcantly after the age of 45. In women, heart attacks are more likely to occur in the years
                    after menopause (usually, after the age of 50). However, younger men and women can also have heart
                    attacks.
                </p>
                <div class="p-header">Besides age, factors that increase the risk for heart attack are:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>A previous heart attack or procedure to open up the coronary arteries </li>
                    <li>Family history of early heart disease
                        <ul type="circle">
                            <li>Father or brother diagnosed before age 55 </li>
                            <li>Mother or sister diagnosed before age 65 </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Diabetes mellitus </li>
                    <li>High blood cholesterol</li>
                    <li>High blood pressure</li>
                    <li>Cigarette smoking</li>
                    <li>Overweight </li>
                    <li>Physical inactivity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have one or more of these factors, see your health care provider to ﬁnd out how to reduce your
                    risk of having a heart attack.
                </p>
                <p>During a heart attack, a clot in the heart’s artery blocks the ﬂow of blood to the heart. Heart
                    muscle begins to die. This is technically called a “myocardial infarction,” meaning “death of heart
                    muscle.” The more time that passes without treatment, the greater the damage. The part of the heart
                    that dies during a heart attack cannot grow back or be repaired.
                </p>
                <p>Fortunately, clot-busting drugs and other artery-opening treatments, such as angioplasty, can stop a
                    heart attack in its tracks. Given soon after symptoms begin, these treatments can prevent or limit
                    damage to the heart. The quicker they are started, the more good they will do and the greater the
                    chances are of a full recovery. To be most effective, these treatments should be given within 1 hour
                    of the start of heart attack symptoms. The beneﬁt of opening the blocked artery decreases with each
                    passing hour from symptom onset until treatment.

                <div class="p-header">Chest Discomfort:</div>
                <p>Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest
                    that lasts for more than a few minutes or that goes away and comes back. The discomfort can feel
                    like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, or fullness
                </p>
                <div class="p-header">Discomfort in other areas of the upper body:</div>

                <div class="p-header">Shortness of breath:</div>
                <p>This symptom often accompanies chest discomfort. However, it can also occur before the chest
                    discomfort.</p>
                <div class="p-header">Other Signs:</div>
                <p>These may include breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea, or light-headedness. Some patients report a
                    sense of impending doom.</p>
